# intro-to-diff-eqns

This week we are starting to look at dynamics in the systems we have been exploring. To do so, we will need to learn how to solve differential equations on a computer. A simply, physically motivated approach due to Euler is a typicaly starting point. This approach used the differential equation, in our case, an equation of motion, to approximate the slope, then extrapolate to an unknown point. Let's start there. We'll see that our choices for making better approaximations are to: (1) decrease how far ahead in time we extrapolate to, and (2) use a better approximation of the slope. It turns out that some combination of (1) and (2) is typically needed for reasonable results. It's often hard to know what *reasonable* looks like. Usually, this is accomplished by approximating the differential equation/equation of motion by something that we know the answer to, making sure our code works for that, then hoping for the best. This approach works quite well provided we make contact with the the generations of mathematitians and scientists who have come before us.
